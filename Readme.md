# HRE4D: Hard Rock E4D
HRE4D is a fork of [E4D by PNNL](https://github.com/pnnl/E4D) made specifcally for geophyscists dealing with hard-rock geology, rather than hydrogeology. Certain terminology and conventions are hence different. As a brief example, instead of conductivity we output resistivity, and we accept observed phase input as positive. This program may be at any stage of completion.

There is also an additional goal of making use of the program as streamlined as possible.
